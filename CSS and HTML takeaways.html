<h1> Key takeaways of CSS and HTML</h1>
    <p>
      In my <strong>Writing with Digital Technologies </strong> class, we are currently learning how to format documents with HTML. We spent most of last week
      learning the basics of HTML, and this week, we are focusing on styles with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). This concept is very new to me, so I'm still catching
      on to how it all works, but from what I've gathered, using CSS helps stylize your HTML document with background colors, fonts and font sizes, and much more! In this
      listicle, I'm going to talk about similarities and differences of HTML and Markdown, ways you can style an HTML document, and tricks for applying style sheets to all
      of your documents.
