<h1> Key takeaways of CSS and HTML</h1>
    <p>
      In my <strong>Writing with Digital Technologies </strong> class, we are currently learning how to format documents with HTML. We spent most of last week
      learning the basics of HTML, and this week, we are focusing on styles with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). This concept is very new to me, so I'm still catching
      on to how it all works, but from what I've gathered, using CSS helps stylize your HTML document with background colors, fonts and font sizes, and much more! In this
      listicle, I'm going to talk about similarities and differences of HTML and Markdown, ways you can style an HTML document, and tricks for applying style sheets to all
      of your documents.
    </p>
    <h2>Similarities and differences between HTML and Markdown</h2>
<p> I would say the biggest similarity between HTML and Markdown is that they both use code to format documents, but this is a very obvious observation. Another more notable
  similarity between the two is that both are compatible in GitHub. This is very convenient because even though it's beneficial to know how to use different code editors and 
  developers, it's nice to only have to use one. That way, you can store different types of documents in the same place, making them easier to find. HTML and Markdown have some 
  distinct differences, however. The biggest one being their code. Markdown is a lightweight markup language, meaning it uses plain text formatting that is purposefully simple
  enough for most to understand. It is very easy to learn, whereas HTML is a bit more difficult because of how many elements there are to learn. Another difference between the 
  two is that writers have more creative freedom with their HTML documents than with their Markdown documents. This is related to my previous point because although HTML
  is more difficult to learn, it correlated directly with how much freedom you have over the style of the document. Users can do a lot more with their documents' styles in 
  HTML, whereas Markdown's simplicity makes it difficult implement different styles.

<h2>Ways you can style an HTML document using CSS</h2>
    <p>

Using CSS gives writers the ability to stylize their document in many different ways. First and foremost, users can change entire sections of their document by typing <code>
  body</code> followed by a <code>{</code> then typing whatever styles they want within the curly brackets. Users can change the font and font size of their document 
      by using <code>font-family:</code> or <code>font size:</code> followed by the desired font name and size point.. To apply background colors, just type <code>background-color:</code>
      followed by the desired color.

<h2>How to apply style sheets to all of your documents in GitHub</h2>
    <p>
If users want an easy way to apply the same style to all of their documents without editing each one in full, start a CSS file in GitHub containing all of the
    desired styles. Once that is done, commit changes and open the document you plan to edit. Type the element <code><link rel="stylesheet" href=""></code> and in the empty 
      quotes, type the name of the CSS file containing the styles. This will apply all styles listed in the file to the document.
      
    </p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      CSS is a great way to add flair to your HTML documents. Styles can be easily applied to documents using style sheets, and is extremely compatible with GitHub and Visual
      Studio Code
